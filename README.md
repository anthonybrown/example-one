I have wanted to learn and use Three.js for some time now.
Why not use react-three-fiber than? I get the best of both worlds.
A declarative, component based scenes. It allows me to write three.js
objects in a declarative way. You can build up scenes reusing react components
using props, hooks, states. It doesn't get better than this (if you know of
something better, let me know!).

I hope to keep learning about this amazing technology to build apps and experiences
that captivate the audience and users of my applications and sites.
